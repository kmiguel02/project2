Self-Critique: I and another team member took on the role of working on HTML. That was our strongest area of knowledge. We split the pages up in a random order. The other team members focused on the CSS and JavaScript. I believe I put my best effort in and expanded my knowledge more. I was reponsible with all the tasks asked from me and contributed to the team as a whole.

Diana: She was the other team member that worked on the HTML. She also contributed completely to the team and was responsible with her tasks. She was very helpful in case other team members need help. 
Tenzin: It was a little hard to communicate becuase she was an online student. She completed all turn-in and labs on time. She was very helpful and open to help. Her strong suits were JavaScript.
Daisy: She was very helpful with the CSS files. Her strengths were design and color schemes. She is very artistic which was a good balance. Also, very responsiblle with all the roles she asked from her.
